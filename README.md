# 🎄 Advent of Code 🎄

## 🌟 Introduction

These are my personal solutions to the puzzles, some I thought of myself, others were inspired by the many great Advent coders out there. Thanks Tom for this great README.

## 📝 Requirements

- **Python**. Required for all solutions.

## 📝 Additional setup

**.zshrc**.
Added the following aliases:

```sh
export AOC_SESSION=""
alias aot="echo -ne '\\e[0;34m'; python3 main.py < test_input.txt; echo -ne '\\e[0m'"
alias aos="python3 main.py < input.txt"
```
